  <p>When culottes first started showing up in shops, I couldn’t believe my eyes. My longtime associations with the style center around either sensible lady uniforms—think meter maids and scout troop leaders—or grannies in Easy Spirit loafers. Even as the traditionally dowdy trousers started to trickle farther down the fashion chain for this year’s summer style, I had my doubts. What could be flattering about pants whose key descriptors are “short” and “wide”? Neither is a word I especially like to align myself with, you know?</p>

     <p>Culottes have made a comeback and they’re set to be one of the season’s biggest trends. The billowy silhouette of these pants works well as a casual outfit when worn with a singlet and flats but can be dressed up with the addition of a camisole and heels. This season you’ll find culottes  in various fabrics and colours so you’re almost certainly going to find one to suit every occasion.</p>
