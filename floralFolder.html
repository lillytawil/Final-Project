      <p>How cute and whimsy is floral maxi dress? I fell in love with it when I saw it on the rack at Nordstrom, but I love it even more when I saw it in action in the wind. It has so much movement and looks so romantic. The all-over side slits couldn’t have been designed more perfectly. I was worried this dress might be too long for me, but with my Stuart Weitzman Nudist the dress barely grazes the floor. I have to admit, I’m a creature of habit. I have been wearing my Nudist a lot lately. They just go with every single outfit I have! They’re probably one of the most versatile pairs I own.
Since we talked about transitional fashion in the last post, I think this dress is a great addition for this theme. The airy chiffon fabric gives it a summery feel while the dark floral print is perfect for fall also. A cropped moto jacket would go so well with this dress.</p>
